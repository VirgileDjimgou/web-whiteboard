# web-whiteboard

A clojure/clojurescript whiteboard for interactive drawing in the browser

## Overview

This project is meant to create a clojure system that can allow multiple
clients to collaboratively draw together.

Currently, I am working out the kinks in going from a JavaScript version
to a ClojureScript version on a single client.

The next pieces will be:

1. Create a web server that can stream svg events via websockets

2. Use [tangoclj]() on the server to handle coordinating with multiple
   clients.

3. Grow out the idea some more to allow saving, replay, etc.

## Setup

Build the ClojureScript

```
lein cljsbuild once
```

Run the web server (which serves resources/public)
```
lein ring server-headless
```

Then, just go to either of the links

http://localhost:3000/v001-js-demo.html
http://localhost:3000/v002-cljs-demo.html

The two demos should show the evolution, and I might follow up with a
blog about my insights in doing the migration.
